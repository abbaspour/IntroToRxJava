        Reactive programming is not a new concept. I remember studying my first Event Driven
        module for Visual Basic 5 in 2000. Even then the technology (Visual Basic 5) was
        already considered somewhat dated. Long before VB5 and the turn of the millennium,
        we have seen languages supporting events. Over time languages like Smalltalk, Delphi
        and the .NET languages have popularized reactive or event-driven programming paradigms.
        This not to say that events are pass√©: current trends such as CEP (Complex
        Event Processing), CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and rich immersive
        GUIs, all have events as a fundamental part of their makeup.
